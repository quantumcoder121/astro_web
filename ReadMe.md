There are 3 folders in this repo. The first one i.e. apod is for the app which shows the Astronomy Picture Of the Day (APOD) on the webpage. The second one i.e. astro_web is for the actual project. The third one i.e. feedback_form is for the feedback form app which shows a form and also previous responses. The file manage.py is for managing this project and db.sqlite3 is for the database of this project. Unfortunately, I could not deploy the apps on Heroku App due to issues with my own laptop. I have also uploaded a video demonstrating the working of the website on my laptop.
